## Info

GAD-002

- Name: Eating book
- Class: Neutral, Contained
- Type: Object/Book
- Security level: 4
- Anomalistic Effect: GAD-002 provides all information about almost everything he has eaten. However, the more he eats from, for example, a plant, the more information you can find. You can get to the information by reading from GAD-002.
- Security Measures: GAD-002 is locked in a 3x3x3 meter room with 10cm thick steel walls. Staff must give GAD-002 something to eat every 12 hours. If GAD-002 does not get anything to eat it starts to move after 2 hours and becomes quite aggressive and attacks everything and everyone near it. After feeding, level 4 staff may approach and read from it.

GAD-002 is neutral and only attacks after it has not eaten anything for 14 hours. Furthermore, GAD-002 cannot be destroyed because its abnormal ability makes it indestructible. Level 4 employees are authorized to read from GAD-002 after feeding. In doing so, GAD-002 behaves peacefully. However, if any damage is done to GAD-002, GAD-002 will attack immediately.

GAD-002 was found in a ruin in a mountain range.
