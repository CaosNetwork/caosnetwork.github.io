## Safe

Safe is the classification for non Anomalistic objects.

## Anomalistic

Anomalistic is the classification for unidentified Anomalistic objects which haven't done anything yet.

## Harmless

Harmless is the classification for Anomalistic Objects which can't kill or hurt Humans or other Lifeforms.

## Neutral

Neutral is the classification for Anomalistic objects that only attack if you attack them.

## Harmfull

Harmfull is the classification for Anomalistic objects that will try to hurt Humans and/or other Lifeforms but can't kill them.

## Dangerous

Dangerous is the classification for Anomalistic objects that will try to kill Humans and/or other Lifeforms.

## EotW

EotW or `End of the World` lists Anomalistic objects which can and will destroy our World (Our World is the Planet Earth) but could destroy nothing else. It has three Sub-Classes which are:

1. XW (Extra Dangerous)
2. XXW (Extra Extra Dangerous)
and
3. UW (Ultra Dangerous)

## EotU

EotU or `End of the Universe` lists Anomalistic objects which can and will destroy our Universe (Our Universe is the Milkyway) but could destroy nothing else. It has three Sub-Classes which are:

1. XU (Extra Dangerous)
2. XXU (Extra Extra Dangerous)
and
3. UU (Ultra Dangerous)

## EoR

EoR or `End of Reality` lists Anomalistic objects which can and will destroy our Reality (Our Reality is our Part of the Multiverse{MV-λ∑}). It has three Sub-Classes which are:

1. XR (Extra Dangerous)
2. XXR (Extra Extra Dangerous)
and
3. UR (Ultra Dangerous)

## Reality Changing

Every class except Safe can have this Stamp which just means it could potentially overwrite our Reality.

## Neutralized

Neutralized is the classification for Anomalistic objects which lost the Anomalistic Properties/Abilitys or are no longer Alive.

## Presumed Neutralized

Presumed Neutralized is the classification for Anomalistic objects where the GAD doesn't know if they are Neutralized but can't find evidence if it is still there.

## Contained

Contained is a Sub-Class of every classification except Safe and Neutralized and lists all Anomalistic objets which are in Containment
